# ProxySwap Overview

## Protocol, Interface, Studio

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "ProxySwap", some of which may confuse new users.

* Proxy Studio: The company which developed the Proxyswap protocol, that is a fork of Uniswap [V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/docs/blob/main/docs/contracts/v3/overview.md) protocol, along with the web interface.
* The ProxySwap Protocol: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the DegenChain L3 blockchain.
* The ProxySwap Interface: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the ProxySwap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the ProxySwap protocol.
* ProxySwap Governance DAO: A governance system for governing the ProxySwap Protocol, enabled by the $PROXY token.
